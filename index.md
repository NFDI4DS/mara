MaRA 2025 features [DaMaLOS](https://zbmed.github.io/damalos) and [AIRDeM](https://ai4rdm.github.io/AIRDeM/) as joint workshops on Management for Research Aftifacts. Value of management plans is broadly recognized by the research community particularly when it comes to research data. However, there are other research artifacts (e.g., software, workflows) that also need to be managed and aligned to research data (targeted by DaMaLOS). In addition to management plans, there is also a need of machine-actionability, i.e., a semantic metadata layer improving FAIR and enabling, for instance, the creation of knowledge graphs (targeted by DaMaLOS and AIRDeM). Management plans and machine-actionablity benefit from Artificial Intelligence approaches to, for instance, improve metadata or connect research artifacts to each other (targeted by DaMaLOs and AIRDeM).

MaRA is part of [NFDI4DataScience](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/) and [NFDI4Health](https://www.nfdi4health.de/en/), two consortia part of the German National Research Data Infrastructures [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en).

## DaMaLOS 
DaMaLOS --Fifth Workshop on Metadata and Research (objects) Management for Linked Open Science, explores requirements for research digital objects and their corresponding management plans to effectively instantiate an integrated layer supporting Linked Open Science. DaMaLOS welcomes contributions aligned to the following topics: **machine-actionable DMPs and SMPs; AI (e.g., machine/deep learning) approaches around rich metadata; FAIRification; FAIR by design; FAIR tooling; recognition, publication and citation for data, software and other research digital objects, and scientometrics beyond the scholarly publication** (i.e., combining the different digital objects playing a role in the research cycle)

## AIRDeM
AIRDeM --Artificial Intelligence for Research Data Management, explores the application of AI-driven solutions and interdisciplinary approaches for RDM, focussing on topics like automated metadata extraction, annotation, and generation, and how these AI techniques can help in improving data findability, accessibility, and quality, interpretability and searchability.
